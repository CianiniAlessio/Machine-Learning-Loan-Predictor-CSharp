# Machine-Learning-Loan-Predictor-CSharp
Nowdays getting a loan is getting more and more difficult and the answer to know if a person is eligible fora
loan or not may take some time to be gathered.
Therefore In this project my main goal is to predict if the amount of loan that a person asked based on
different variable is going to be given.
These variables are:  #**ApplicantIncome,CoapplicantIncome,LoanAmount,Credit_History** .
I downloaded from Kaggle a dataset in which there is a train dataset in which is shown if the user is eligible
for the loan or not.
The other set is the test dataset that I will use to evaluate my created model.
